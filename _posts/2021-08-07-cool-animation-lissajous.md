I like animations a lot! Making animations is hard though, so it's especially nice when I don't need to do much animating myself. I was sitting around trying to think of something I could animate, when I remembered about [Lissajous curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve)!

*My first (successful) attempt, where I slowly increase the frequency of the sin wave for the y coordinate.*

After some looking around, I saw people doing much cooler Lissajous animations, so I decided I had to step up my game.

*A table of the different Lissajous curves and their constituent waves. Heavily inspired by other examples I saw on the internet, so this definitely wasn't my idea!*
